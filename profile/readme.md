**Chess Bras** is a projet that was created by students of Sherbrooke University in Quebec, Canada. The projet's goal is to execute a chess game with a robotic opponent. To due so, a robotic arm and an intelligent board game were created.

<br>The following table of content will direct you to the different elements in our projet

## Led's Color code *To move eventually in a complete instruction guide of the game*
The RGB Led indicates the different states of the game 
- **Start**: 
     <br>a bright **light blue** led will appear
- **Humain's turn to play**: 
     <br>a bright **green** led will appear
- **Robot's turn to play**:
     <br>a bright **blue** led will appear
- **Problem**: 
     <br>a bright **red** led will appear
- **You Lost**: 
     <br>the led will **turnoff** itself
- **You Won**: 
     <br>the led will turnon into **party mode**. Party mode flashes many different colors one after the other to indicate that you have won the game.
